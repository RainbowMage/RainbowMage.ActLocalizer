  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-btnExportUIBrowser">Press this button to start a wizard allowing you to set the EQ2's web browser to ACT's encounter index and optionally extracting a browser UI replacement with a collapsable interface and controls for maximum screen space.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-btnOdbcDropTables">This will perform the DROP command on each table ACT uses.  This will delete all table data and remove the tables from the datasource.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-btnOdbcTestConnection">This will attempt to log into the ODBC datasource specified in the Connection String.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-btnOdbcValidateTables">This will make sure the ODBC datasource has the required tables and the tables have the required columns.  If anything is missing, ACT will attempt to create or alter the tables.  Success is required to do SQL exporting.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-cbBlockisHit">When checked, a hit that reports that it fails to inflict any damage will still be considered a Hit.  When unchecked, only an attack that does damage is considered successful.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-cbCurrentOdbc">When in combat, ACT can export to a temporary table called current_table on your ODBC datasource every few seconds.  Every export, the table will be deleted and refilled to reflect the current encounter.  This option is only recommended if you have a very quick connection to your datasource.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-cbDoubleBufferLV">When checked, ACT will attempt to enable minimal redrawing of the main table.  Windows versions before WindowsXP normally do not have this ability and may cause undesired results.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-cbExGraph">When checked, HTML exports will include a main encounter graph.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-cbExHTML">EQ2 comes with an integrated web browser based on FireFox.  This can be used to view data exported by ACT while in fullscreen.  The main encounter table will be exported as HTML to be viewed within the EQ2 HTML window.  To access the HTML window, type: "/browser"</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-cbExHTMLFTP">If checked, when ACT exports EQ2 compatible HTML files, it will attempt to upload them to an FTP server of your choice.  Make sure to test your settings before use.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-cbExOdbc">This will enable SQL exporting via ODBC automatically when an encounter ends.

To use this feature, you need an ODBC driver to connect to your datasource and to fill out the Connection String with the remote host info. http://connectionstrings.com/ can help you make a connection string for your specific SQL datasource.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-cbExportBeep">When checked, any exporting to the clipboard will cause a default system beep.  This is a good indication of when an encounter is ended and there is new data to paste into EQ2.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-cbExportFilterSpace">When checked, the Mini Parse window and clipboard exporting will exclude any combatants with spaces in their names.  This will exclude most mobs such as 'a giant bat' or 'King Drayek', but not 'Anguis' or 'Frostbite'.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-cbExText">Combatant summaries for the encounter will be exported to the clipboard after an encounter has ended.  These summaries can be pasted into EQ2 by pressing Ctrl-V, and customized under General Options -&gt; Text Only Formatting -&gt; Clipboard Export Formatting.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-cbGermanMergeNames">If enabled, combatants with grammatical changes such as: ruhiger Wachposten, ruhigen Wachpostens s, ruhigen Wachposten, ruhige Wachposten, ruhigen Wachposten en; will all show up as the same combatant.  (Which ever showed up first in an encounter)</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-cbGExpEnd">If 'You gain bonus experience for defeating the encounter!' is seen, the encounter will be considered ended. 
('You convert experience into achievement experience!' twice in a single second will also trigger this.)</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-cbGraphSoloInc">When unchecked, solo combatant graphs will only show DPS lines for outgoing damage.  When checked, incoming damage and incoming heal DPS lines will also be generated.  (This will slightly increase the CPU time used to generate)</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-cbHtmlTimers">When checked, ACT will export an HTML page displaying the current view of the Timers Window.  The timer view will have the same dimensions as the original window, so resize it to your needs.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-cbIdleEnd">If no combat actions such as attacking are observed for N number of seconds, the encounter will be considered ended.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-cbIdleTimerEnd">A previously defaulted non-option, ACT can internally count seconds of inactivity instead of waiting on a log timestamp with a time sufficiently after the last combat action.  If disabled, ACT will only end encounters based off of timestamps, and if no new log lines are parsed, its possible to never end an encounter *until* a new log timestamp is seen from EQ2.  When enabled, the timer will not strictly end an encounter based off the timer, but two seconds after (in absense of log timestamps).</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-cbKillEnd">When an allied combatant kills another, the encounter will be considered ended.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-cbLcdRoute">When the ACT Clipboard Sharer is connected, using this option will route all LCD traffic to the G15 LCD on the connected computer's keyboard.  This allows you to run ACT on a different computer than EQ2 and retain all LCD functionality.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-cbLongEncDuration">Previously when only using timed encounter ending, heals being cast while the delay was counting down could affect the encounter's total duration, and therefore ExtDPS.  If unchecked, heals after the last combat action will still be recorded up until the encounter is terminated, but will not affect the duration of the encounter.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-cbMiniClickThrough">When enabled, mouse actions will not affect the Mini Window.  When transparency is set, this allows you to both see through and click on things behind the window.  Of course you can no longer move or close the window by normal means until click-through is disabled.  NOTE: You may toggle this option by right-clicking the main window 'Show Mini' button.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-cbMultiDamageIsOne">When enabled, an attack that has multiple damage types, such as "300 crushing, 5 poison and 5 disease damage" will show up as one total attack: 300/5/5 crushing/poison/disease, internally seen as 310.  If disabled, each damage type will show up as an individual swing, IE three attacks: 300 crushing; 5 poison; 5 disease.  Having a single attack show up as multiple will have consequences when calculating ToHit%.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-cbOnlyGraphAllies">When checked, simple encounter bar graphs will only show your allies.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-cbPetIsMaster">When checked, a pet will not show as its own entry, but as a spell under their master.  When unchecked, the pet is considered a seperate combatant and has its own statistics unrelated to its master.
This setting is not retroactive, and will not combine or seperate a pet from its master if the encounter has already taken place.  Only future encounters will be affected by this setting.


Since LU19 and &lt;Purpose tags&gt; showing under a pet's name and not in log files, parsers cannot automatically see who a pet belongs to.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-cbRecalcWardedHits">If enabled, no-damage hits or reduced damage hits immediately following a ward absorbtion will be increased by the absorbtion amount.  Stoneskin's no-damage hits cannot be recalculated.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-cbRecordLogs">When checked, ACT will record all log lines that appear during an encounter.  You may then right click an encounter, select View Logs and view/search through them.  Disabling this option will reduce memory usage by a bit less than 45% when compared to default settings.  Exported ACT files will retain these recorded logs.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-cbRestrictToAll">When checked, under each combatant, the only Damage Types entries that will be fully populated will be the ones marked (Ref) for Reference.  Instead of 'Melee (Out)' showing All, crush, and slash it will only show All, which is a combination of crush/slash.  Crush and slash will still be found under 'All Outgoing (Ref)' due to the (Ref) tag; the listing will simply be more crowded.
Enabling this options willl reduce CPU usage by a bit less than 10% and reduce memory usage by a bit more than 10% when compared to default settings.  Unchecked, this option will populate all entries in their logical listings.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-cbSExpEnd">If 'You gain experience!' is seen, the encounter will be considered ended. 
('You convert experience into achievement experience!' will also trigger this.)</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-cbSqlSafeMode">In safe mode, SQL commands will be sent one at a time and server response checked.  Otherwise commands will be sent in 100 row batches, which while faster will be more problematic to debug.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-cbSwarmIsMaster">When enabled, "Дух огня (персонажа)", "Wässrige Horde des Character" and other similarly named pets will have their attack damage added to their master instead of as their own named entry.  Incoming attacks will *not* be redirected to their master's data.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-cbWebServerEnabled">The ACT Web Interface is somewhat similar to the EQ2 HTML exports in appearance.  Dissimilarly, the web interface is not made up of intermediary HTML files but generated HTML upon request.  By default, you can see auto-updating pages of the current encounter table, Mini-Window text(with support for multiple presets), spell timers and a page that can browse through all of ACT's encounter data in memory.  Context-menu reports based on that data are not currently available but plugins can be made to expand the web interface.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-cbWebServerShowReq">If enabled, all HTTP requests will be shown.  Otherwise things like auto-updating portions of pages or .css/.js files will be hidden (unless very large).  One request to '/timers'(always shown) may initiate requests to '/ACT.js', '/ACT.css' and '/timers.body'(optionally shown) as well.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-cbZoneAllListing">As the first encounter of each Zone branch, an "All" entry can exist which will combine all data from other encounters for that zone.  As encounters progress within that zone, the All entry will be updated in real time.  The All encounter entry will be identical to a merged encounter of all encounters within that zone.

Disabling this option will reduce memory and CPU usage a bit more than 10% when compared to default options.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-CurrentExports">Checking this will create a custom HTML page with an auto updating graph or table.  The page will auto-refresh at the user specified interval providing more or less a real-time view of the encounter.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-ddlGraphPriority">This setting will change the priority of graph generation.  All programs have a priority, usually Normal by default, and this priority defines how much CPU time should be given to the current task.  If set to Lowest(Idle), graph generation will only take CPU time not used by other applications.  If EQ2 is running, this will be next to nothing.  Normal priority will give equal amounts of CPU time to ACT and any other task, such as EQ2. Above Normal(Not recommended) will give graph generation more priority than most other programs and may cause noticable stuttering in EQ2 momentary freezing.  ACT's UI may also become unresponsive during graph generation.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-ddlLanguage">This will change the parsing engine to another language or Spell Timers only mode.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-ExFTPPASV">If you are behind a router or have multiple NICs you may need to use Passive mode transfers.  If the target FTP server is under the same conditions(a PASV only state), you must use Active mode.  Two machines that require PASV mode cannot establish FTP transfers.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-GraphSize">This will set the image dimentions of the graph in HTML exporting and EQ2 viewing.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-GraphType">Select a graphing method for the main encounter display.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-lblWebServerPort">The listening port to accept HTTP requests from.  If you use a non-standard port (80), clients must add that port to their URL notation like the following: http://127.0.0.1:80/</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-LogPriority">This setting will change the priority of normal log parsing.  All programs have a priority, usually Normal by default, and this priority defines how much CPU time should be given to the current task.  If set to Lowest(Idle), log parsing will only take CPU time not used by other applications.  If EQ2 is running, this will be next to nothing.  Normal priority will give equal amounts of CPU time to ACT and any other task, such as EQ2.

If ACT seems unable to keep up with log parsing tasks while EQ2 is running, you may wish to set this to Above Normal.

For this setting to take effect, you must restart ACT or Close and Reopen the current log.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-SampleType">These settings affect how many DPS plots there are along the X-Axis.  If an encounter is one minute long, and Fixed number of DPS samples(6) is selected, there will be six X-Axis plots in 10 second intervals.  If DPS samples every 15 seconds is selected, there will be four DPS plots at 15 second intervals.  Fixed number is useful for keeping a graph readable no matter how long the encounter, and fixed sample durations is useful for comparisons to other time lines.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-tbCharName">If a log file is open this setting is ignored; however if ACT is used as an offline parser only, this setting will be used to fill in your name instead of using 'YOU'.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-TextFormatAddPreset">Save these format options to the drop down list.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-TextFormatAllies">Allies formatting string. (First Line Format)</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-TextFormatAlliesOnly">When checked, only combatants who have proven themselves allies in the encounter will be included in the export.  This includes healing you or other proven allies, or attacking your foes.  If you do not make any allies during the encounter, all combatants will be exported.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-TextFormatAlliesStats">When checked, the totals of your allies will be prefixed to the normal export.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-TextFormatPlayers">Per-player formatting string. (Repeating Format)</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-TextFormatPreset">Replace the current formatters with a saved preset.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-TextFormatRemovePreset">Remove the currently selected format from the drop down list.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-TextFormatSort">The sorting method this formatting option will use.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-cbCullAll">When a new zone listing is created, ACT will keep the listed number of "All" zone-wide encounters and cull the older.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-cbCullCount">When an encounter ends, normal encounters are culled to the listed number.  This applies to encounters in any current or previous zone but will not affect "All" zone-wide encounters.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-cbCullCountIgnoreNoAlly">Encounters with no allies, marked "Encounter" will not add to the count when determining the number of old encounters to cull.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-cbCullNoAlly">When an encounter ends, all encounters (except for the last) labeled "Encounter" will be removed.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-cbCullOther">When a new zone listing is created, ACT will keep the normal encounters of this many previous zones.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="Help Panel Mouseover" Key="helpPanel-cbCullTimer">When an encounter ends, all encounters (except for "All" zone-wide encounters) older than this time limit will be removed.</MiscTranslationEntry>

  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="" Key="helpPanel-xmlShare">This section is designed for importing small snippets of settings such as Custom Triggers or Spell Timers.  Typically these snippets will be parsed from game chat but may also be copied from elsewhere and pasted.

When an XML snippet is detected in chat, by default the character name and type of data will appear in the third(yellow) ListBox.  You may then click on the data to review it in the TextBox to the right and either import or delete the entry.

If you wish to always import data from a particular character, you may enter their name into the TextBox above the yellow ListBox and click the above Add button.  Similarly there is a list of characters to always ignore data from.  You may temporarily disable an accept/reject entry by unchecking it or you may simply use the Remove button on either list.

You may possibly come across an XML snippet from another source made for this feature.  Instead of having someone send it to you in a tell, you may paste it directly into the larger TextBox above the Import/Delete buttons.  It will then appear as a custom entry allowing you to Import or Delete it.

You may create a snippet from your own data by going into either the Spell Timers options page or Custom Triggers tab, right-clicking the entry in the list and selecting Copy as Sharable XML.  If sending in EQ2 chat, the XML snippet must be by itself with no other chat or spaces.</MiscTranslationEntry>
  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="" Key="helpPanel-xmlSubscription">This section is for keeping up to date with external ACT settings.  XML configuration files can be put on the web and upon startup or on demand, ACT can check these files for updates(based on the timestamp).  ACT can be set to automatically import or notify the user of these updates.

The top ListBox will contain the external URLs of the files already being watched.  To add an entry, enter the URL into the labeled TextBox, select an update option and click Add/Edit.  As update options, you can have ACT check but ignore updated files, notify you of updates using a message box or automatically import the external XML file upon detected updates.  The Query URL button will list the general contents of the URL, if valid, and list when it was marked changed.  The View in browser link will open the URL in your default web browser.

The Check Now button will on demand check all of the URLs for changes and check-mark the updated files.  If the URL has been updated but set to be ignored, it will be marked with a gray checkmark.  You may manually check or uncheck an entry by clicking on it.

The Update Checked button will import all entries with a normal checkmark regardless of if they were detected as changed.</MiscTranslationEntry>

  <MiscTranslationEntry Description="" Key="helpPanel-rbSParseFull">Full selective parsing should only be used in small groups where there are other groups near by.  When the encounter begins, the settings are locked to that encounter.  Using this feature may cause the ExtDPS calculations to differ from other copies of ACT or other parsers depending on the limiting options they use.  Once an encounter has taken place, you cannot add or remove combatants  to it without reparsing that battle.  Full selective parsing will create data gaps and should not be used while using ACT to analyze battles or statistics as it will not show a complete "picture" of the encounter.</MiscTranslationEntry>
